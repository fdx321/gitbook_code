# 原子类

```java
private static final long valueOffset;
static { 
  try {  
    valueOffset = unsafe.objectFieldOffset(AtomicInteger.class.getDeclaredField("value"));
  } catch (Exception ex) { 
     throw new Error(ex); 
  }
}
private volatile int value;

```

基本都雷同，都是利用Unsafe的objectFieldOffset方法获取value在内存中位置，然后利用Unsafe的compareAndSwap/getAndAddInt/getAndAddLong等方法进行原子的update.

可以看到，很多atomic类中都有lazySet方法，关于这个方法，可以参考：

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1468007/atomicinteger-lazyset-vs-set

_As probably the last little JSR166 follow-up for Mustang, we added a "lazySet" method to the Atomic classes \(AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, etc\). This is a niche method that is sometimes useful when fine-tuning code using non-blocking data structures. The semantics are that the write is guaranteed not to be re-ordered with any previous write, but may be reordered with subsequent operations \(or equivalently, might not be visible to other threads\) until some other volatile write or synchronizing action occurs\)._

_The main use case is for nulling out fields of nodes in non-blocking data structures solely for the sake of avoiding long-term garbage retention; it applies when it is harmless if other threads see non-null values for a while, but you'd like to ensure that structures are eventually GCable. In such cases, you can get better performance by avoiding the costs of the null volatile-write. There are a few other use cases along these lines for non-reference-based atomics as well, so the method is supported across all of the AtomicX classes._

_For people who like to think of these operations in terms of machine-level barriers on common multiprocessors, lazySet provides a preceeding store-store barrier \(which is either a no-op or very cheap on current platforms\), but no store-load barrier \(which is usually the expensive part of a volatile-write\)._
